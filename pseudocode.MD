How would i use javascript to get the current time
How would i use javascript to keep the time counting without refreshing
how would i use javascript to get the 24hr time clock as well
how would i use javascript to change between the 12hr/24hr

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
setintervals to keep it updating per millisecond?
button eventlistener for 12 to 24hr change?

POSSIBLE CODE
const intervalID = setInterval(myCallback, 500, 'Parameter 1', 'Parameter 2');

function myCallback(a, b)
